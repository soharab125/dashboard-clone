# AI Usage Report

This document outlines the use of AI coding tools in the development of the Dashboard Clone project.

## AI Tools Used

- **Cursor**: An AI-powered code editor was used for the entire development process. It helped with code generation, autocompletion, and debugging.
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: The underlying AI model that powered the code generation and provided suggestions.

## AI-Assisted Development

The AI tools were heavily utilized in the following areas:

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration

- **Next.js Initialization**: The initial command to set up the Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS was generated by the AI.
- **Environment Variables**: The AI assisted in setting up the `.env.local` file and explaining how to store the API key securely.

### 2. TypeScript Typing

- The TypeScript interfaces for the TMDB API response (`Movie` and `MovieApiResponse`) were generated by the AI, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

### 3. Component Generation

- **Header Component**: The entire `Header` component, including the JSX and Tailwind CSS classes, was generated by the AI based on a high-level description.
- **Hero Banner Component**: The AI generated the `HeroBanner` component, including the use of the Next.js `<Image>` component with `fill` and `priority` props for optimization.
- **MovieRow Component**: The reusable `MovieRow` client component was generated by the AI, including the logic for horizontal scrolling and linking to the detail page.
- **Movie Detail Page**: The AI generated the dynamic route and the component for the movie detail page, including the data fetching logic and the responsive layout.

### 4. Tailwind CSS Styling

- All the Tailwind CSS classes used for styling the components were generated by the AI. This includes the responsive design, hover effects, and the overall modern look and feel of the application.

### 5. API Integration

- The utility functions in `src/services/api.ts` for fetching data from the TMDB API were generated by the AI. This included handling the API key and constructing the API request URLs.
